								<p>KaloBios’ patented proprietary Humaneered® technology platform is designed to address problems of therapeutic antibodies (e.g., specificity, affinity, immunogenicity, etc.), as well as equally important downstream processing issues (e.g., solubility, expression, aggregation, etc.). The process is fast and produces antibodies close to human germ-line in sequence while retaining the specificity and improving the affinity of the reference antibody. Humaneered® antibodies have now been tested clinically and to date no anti-drug antibodies have been detected even after dosing healthy human volunteers.</p>
