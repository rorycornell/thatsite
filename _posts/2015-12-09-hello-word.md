At Vivacitas Bio, we believe that everyone should have equal affordable access to medical care. Our goal is to develop treatments that improve the lives of cancer patients. Patients and their families dealing with a cancer diagnosis need more than treatment. We believe that patients and their families deserve access to information, support, and advocacy.
