dont edit the root index.html  Its generated automatically by jekyll.

You edit the about/index.html, contact/index.html, etc

New blog posts must be done in the format I put and be in the _posts

_layouts, _includes are the layout and header and footer


Do not touch anything in _site or the root html files its all autogenerated
