 <h2>Vivacitas Bio Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Vivacitas Bio Pharmaceuticals thanks you for  visiting its web site. Because we are committed to respecting the privacy of  our web site visitors, this web site Privacy Policy describes the information  we may collect from you during your visit to our site, how we may use it, and  how we will protect the information which you may opt to provide. This policy  explains the efforts to balance our business interests in collecting and using  the information we receive from you with your need for appropriate protection  and management of any personally identifiable information that you share with  us.</p>
        <p><strong>Personally  Identifiable Information</strong></p>
        <p>Personally identifiable information includes  your name, address, phone number, e-mail address or any other information which  might reasonably be used to identify you individually. Vivacitas Bio collects  personally identifiable information from web site visitors only when it is  voluntarily provided. Vivacitas Bio will not otherwise collect this information from  you on our web site. At those portions of our web site where we provide you  with the option to input personally identifiable information, we notify you of  the uses we intend to make of that information in any given instance. When Vivacitas Bio  receives personally identifiable information, we may use it for reasonable  business purposes, just as non-Internet businesses do. For example, we may use  this information to contact you, via e-mail or regular mail, to provide you  with information we believe may be of interest. It might also be used for  compiling data and analyses to understand and serve our customers' needs. Data  is also compiled to evaluate the use and utility of the services we provide  on-line. Your information may be transferred for processing and use to Vivacitas Bio  facilities in other countries and regions of the world. Personally identifiable  information will not be sold, rented or exchanged outside of Vivacitas Bio unless the  user is first notified and expressly consents to such transfer.</p>
        <p><strong>Collective/Aggregate  Data</strong></p>
        <p>The Vivacitas Bio web site may also collect  information from you that is not personally identifiable. For example, we might  track information about the date and time visitors access our site, the type of  web browser they used, and the web site from which they connected to our site.  Our web sites collect this information by depositing certain bits of  information called "cookies" in a visitor's computer. This technology does not  collect an individual visitor's personally identifiable information. Rather,  this information is collected in an aggregate form. The cookies can tell us how  and when pages in a web site were visited and by how many people. This  aggregate information will enable us to improve our web sites to serve and  inform you better. It also may allow you to shortcut access to points of  interest on our web site when you re-enter our system. Attaching this device to  your system has no effect on how it performs. If you want to opt-out of this  data collection, please click here and follow the instructions, as provided.</p>
        <p><strong>Links to Other  Sites</strong></p>
        <p>As a resource to our visitors, Vivacitas Bio may  provide links to other web sites. We try to carefully choose web sites, which  we believe are useful and meet our high standards for the accuracy and utility  of information. However, because web site design and content can change so  quickly, we cannot guarantee the standards of every web site to which we link.  Likewise, we are not responsible for the content of any non-Vivacitas Bio site. We  also cannot guarantee the privacy policies of these other sites and suggest you  check the privacy policies of those sites directly.</p>
        <p><strong>Choice</strong></p>
        <p>If you wish to stop receiving any e-mails or  other consumer communications from Vivacitas Bio which may be sent to you in the  future based on your request for this information, or if you have submitted  personally identifiable information through a Vivacitas Bio web site and would like to  have that information deleted from our records, please notify us via the  contact form on the this site. Your wishes in these matters will be honored.</p>
        <p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>
        <p>Vivacitas Bio will make every effort to maintain the  accuracy and confidentiality of any personal information you supply to us. If  you wish to make additions or other corrections to the information that you  have sent in, please transmit it to us via the contact form on this site.</p>
        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
        <p>All information transmitted to this Vivacitas Bio  web site is secure to the extent possible using existing technology.  Unauthorized third parties should not be able to access it during transmission.  We will store the information that you share with us securely and will take  appropriate steps to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure. While  no security steps can offer 100 percent protection, we utilize state-of-the-art  technology and systems to prevent unauthorized access to the information we  hold. We will limit access to this information to those Vivacitas Bio personnel with a  need to know. We educate our staff about their duty to protect your privacy.</p>
        <p><strong>Children</strong></p>
        <p>Vivacitas Bio does not intentionally collect or  retain personally identifiable information about children who are younger than  18 years of age. If your child may have submitted information to us without  indicating their actual age, and you would like it removed, please advise us  through the contact form on the this site, and we will delete it immediately.</p>
        <p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
        <p>
            Any changes to this privacy policy will be  communicated promptly at this location. Please check the privacy page  periodically to review any changes that may have been made.<br>
